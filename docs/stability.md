# Stability, versioning & the path to 1.0

How far each crate has settled, what a version number promises, the MSRV
contract, and the gate this workspace holds itself to before tagging a `1.0`.

## Versioning

Every crate is **versioned and published independently** and adheres to
[SemVer](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html); each has its own `CHANGELOG.md`
([Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/)) and is tagged
`<crate>-v<version>`. There is no workspace-wide version.

While a crate is **pre-1.0 (`0.x`)**, a SemVer **minor** bump (`0.x → 0.(x+1)`)
may carry breaking changes and a **patch** (`0.x.y → 0.x.(y+1)`) is
non-breaking — the standard Cargo `^0.x` interpretation. Breaking changes are
allowed at `0.x` and called out in the changelog's `### Changed`/`### Removed`.
After a crate reaches **`1.0`**, it switches to strict SemVer: breaking changes
require a **major** bump.

Because the crates depend on each other (`vcs-core` → `vcs-git`/`vcs-jj`; the
wrappers → the foundational `vcs-diff`/`vcs-cli-support`), each intra-workspace
dependency carries a `^MAJOR.MINOR` requirement that must stay in range when a
dependency crosses a boundary — see the release process in
[AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md) and the publish ordering in `release.yml`.

## Stability tiers

All crates are **pre-1.0** today — the API may still change. Relative maturity:

| Crate | Version | Tier | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `vcs-diff` | 0.1 | **settling** | Small, pure (diff model + parser, `Version`); shape unlikely to change. |
| `vcs-cli-support` | 0.1 | **settling** | The argv guard, fetch policy, and error classifiers — a narrow, stable surface. |
| `vcs-testkit` | 0.1 | **stable-ish (dev-only)** | Test fixtures; only a dev-dependency, so churn never reaches a release build. |
| `vcs-git` | 0.4 | **maturing** | Broad surface, consumer-validated; new typed methods still land (additive). |
| `vcs-jj` | 0.4 | **maturing** | Tracks jj, whose CLI/template surface churns — see the CI version matrix. |
| `vcs-github` | 0.4 | **maturing** | The `gh` PR/issue/run/release surface; additive growth. |
| `vcs-gitlab` | 0.1 | **new** | The `glab` lean MR lifecycle; argv/JSON pinned by hermetic fixtures, only version/auth smoke-tested against the real binary — expect movement. |
| `vcs-gitea` | 0.1 | **new** | The `tea` lean PR lifecycle (narrower — see its capability notes); expect movement. |
| `vcs-forge` | 0.1 | **new** | The forge facade + unified DTOs; the unification will grow as the wrappers do. |
| `vcs-core` | 0.2 | **evolving** | The facade's common surface grows as cross-backend needs surface (e.g. `snapshot`). |
| `vcs-watch` | 0.1 | **new** | Repo-event stream over `vcs-core`; the workspace's first runtime-tokio + streaming API — the event set and the API may still shift. |
| `vcs-mcp` | 0.1 | **new** | MCP server (a lib + the `vcs-mcp` binary) over `vcs-core`/`vcs-forge`; the workspace's first binary crate. The tool catalogue, names, and JSON shapes will grow as more operations are exposed. |

"Settling" = close to its 1.0 shape; "maturing" = the surface is broad and
proven but still grows additively; "evolving" = expect the most movement; "new" =
just landed, the surface and the empirically-validated CLI argv/JSON may still
shift.

## MSRV policy

The **minimum supported Rust version is 1.88** (edition 2024 needs 1.85, but the
wrappers use let-chains, stabilised in 1.88). It is declared once in
`[workspace.package]` as `rust-version = "1.88"` and inherited by every crate, so
`cargo build` on an older toolchain fails early with a clear message — the
contract is **machine-checked**, not just documented.

An MSRV bump is treated as a **minor**-version change (a `0.x` minor today; a
major after 1.0 if a consumer pins an older toolchain) and is called out in the
changelog. We bump the MSRV only when a dependency or a genuinely useful language
feature requires it — not casually.

## Public-API review checklist (the 1.0 gate)

Before any crate is tagged `1.0`, its public surface is reviewed against the
invariants this workspace already holds (most are enforced today; 1.0 makes them
a promise):

- **Trait object-safety & mockability.** Each `*Api` trait stays object-safe and
  `mockall`-friendly: no generic methods, no nested-reference lifetimes (owned
  `&[String]`/`Option<String>`, not `&[&str]`/`Option<&str>`), so `&dyn Api`,
  `async-trait`, and the `mock` feature all keep working.
- **`#[non_exhaustive]` on returned types.** Every struct/enum a consumer *reads*
  (DTOs, parsed results) is `#[non_exhaustive]` so a new field/variant isn't a
  breaking change — except deliberate value types (`Version`) that callers
  legitimately construct.
- **Structured errors.** Failures surface as `processkit::Error` variants
  (`Exit`/`Timeout`/`Spawn`/`Parse`), never a stringly-typed blob; the facade adds
  only repo-detection variants. Classifiers (`is_merge_conflict`, …) give intent
  without matching on internals.
- **Injection-safe by default.** Caller strings in bare positional argv slots are
  guarded (`reject_flag_like`); flag-value slots are documented as exempt.
- **No leaked internals.** Re-exports are explicit (no glob leaks); private
  parsers/helpers stay private; the `cli_client!` seam isn't part of the surface.
- **Docs + tests.** Every public method has a doc comment and at least a hermetic
  test pinning its argv/parse; the pure parsers are property-tested for
  panic-freedom; real-binary behaviour is covered by the `#[ignore]` integration
  suites (CI version-matrixes jj).
