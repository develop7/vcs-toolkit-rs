# Changelog — vcs-github

All notable changes to the `vcs-github` crate are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this crate adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).
This crate is versioned and published independently of the other workspace
crates; tag releases as `vcs-github-v<version>`.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Per-operation credentials (opt-in).** `GitHub::with_credentials(provider)`
  accepts a `CredentialProvider` (re-exported from `vcs-cli-support`, along with
  `Credential`/`Secret`/`StaticCredential`/`EnvToken`/`provider_fn`), plus the
  convenience `GitHub::with_token(token)` / `with_env_token(var)` for the common
  cases. The resolved token is injected as `GH_TOKEN` on every `gh` invocation —
  never in `argv` — overriding the ambient login. Default is no provider → ambient
  `gh` auth, unchanged. (Internally the client now wraps `vcs-cli-support`'s
  `ManagedClient` instead of the `cli_client!` macro; the public constructor/builder
  surface is unchanged.)
- `CheckBucket` enum (`Pass`/`Fail`/`Pending`/`Skipping`/`Cancel`/`Unknown`) with
  `is_failing`/`is_pending`/`is_passing` helpers — the typed form of gh's check
  categorisation, `#[non_exhaustive]` with an `Unknown` catch-all so a future gh
  bucket never breaks the parse.
- `pr_edit(dir, number, PrEdit)` — edit a pull request's title and/or body
  (`gh pr edit <n> [--title <title>] [--body <body>]`). A new `PrEdit` builder
  (`new()`, `.title(..)`, `.body(..)`) carries the optional fields; absent
  flags are not emitted, so the argv reflects exactly the fields the caller
  set. An empty string is treated as a real value (gh clears the field on
  `--title ""` / `--body ""`), not as `None`. The trait method is
  **defaulted** to `Error::Unsupported` so external implementers keep
  compiling when the crate bumps — only the `GitHub` concrete impl and the
  regenerated `MockGitHubApi` override it.

### Changed
- `issue_list` now fetches `body` and `url` too (widened `--json` field list), so
  the listed `Issue`s carry them instead of leaving them empty until `issue_view`.
- **`CheckRun::bucket` is now `CheckBucket` (breaking)**, replacing the
  stringly-typed `String` — exhaustive matching instead of comparing string slices.
- Bumped `processkit` to **0.11.0** (from 0.9.1), a major breaking release ahead
  of processkit's 1.0 freeze. Breaking for downstream via the re-exported
  `processkit::Error`: `Error::Timeout`/`Signalled` now carry partial
  `stdout`/`stderr`, `Error::Signalled`/`NotFound`/`CassetteMiss` are first-class
  variants, the blanket `From<io::Error>` is gone, and `Invocation::cwd` is now
  `Option<PathBuf>`.

### Removed
- The **`cancellation`** feature — cancellation is always available now
  (processkit 0.10 made it core), so the `cli_client!`-generated
  `default_cancel_on(token)` and the re-exported `CancellationToken` no longer sit
  behind a feature. Downstream that enabled `vcs-github/cancellation` should drop it.

### Fixed
- `pr_checks` detects gh's "no checks reported" (a PR with no checks → empty list)
  case-insensitively, so a capitalization tweak in gh's wording can't turn the
  no-checks case into a hard error.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-06-08

### Added
- PR lifecycle mutations: `pr_merge(dir, n, PrMerge)` — a `PrMerge` builder
  (`merge()`/`squash()`/`rebase()`, `.auto()`, `.delete_branch()`);
  `pr_ready(dir, n)`; `pr_close(dir, n, delete_branch)`.
- `pr_checks(dir, n)` → `Vec<CheckRun>` (`pr checks --json …`). gh signals the
  overall outcome via its exit code (0 pass / 8 pending / 1 some failed) but
  prints the same JSON for all three — all return the parsed list; branch on
  `CheckRun::bucket` (`pass`/`fail`/`pending`/`skipping`/`cancel`).
- Reviews and comments: `pr_review(dir, n, ReviewAction)` — `ReviewAction`
  (`approve()` / `request_changes(body)` / `comment(body)`, `.with_body(..)`,
  `kind()`/`body()`) carries a required body for request-changes/comment by
  construction, so an empty-body request-changes is unrepresentable;
  `pr_comment(dir, n, body)` → URL; `pr_feedback(dir, n)` → `PrFeedback`
  (reviews + conversation comments from `pr view --json reviews,comments`,
  nested authors flattened).
- GitHub Actions runs: `run_list(dir, limit, branch)` / `run_view(dir, id)` →
  `WorkflowRun` (`conclusion` is an *empty string* until the run completes —
  gh's shape), and `run_watch(dir, id)` — blocks until the run finishes, then
  returns the final `WorkflowRun` (the watch exit code can't distinguish a
  failed run from a cancelled one, so the outcome is read via `run view`).
  `run_watch` under a client `default_timeout` is killed at the deadline.
- Issues and releases: `issue_create(dir, title, body)` → URL;
  `issue_view(dir, n)` (fills the new `Issue::body`/`Issue::url`);
  `release_list(dir)` / `release_view(dir, tag)` → `Release` (`is_latest` is
  reported by `list` only).
- All new dir-taking methods are mirrored on the `GitHubAt` bound view.
- Injection guards on the exposed positional arguments (`api` endpoint,
  `release_view` tag): a leading-`-` or empty value is refused **before**
  anything spawns. Flag-value positions (`--body`, `--branch`) need no
  guard — gh consumes the next token verbatim there.

### Changed
- **Breaking:** `pr_create` now takes a single `PrCreate` spec
  (`pr_create(dir, PrCreate)`) instead of the `(title, body, head, base)`
  argument list. Build it with `PrCreate::new(title, body)` plus the chained
  `.head(..)` / `.base(..)` setters. Argv unchanged.
- **Breaking:** `ReviewAction` is now a struct with **private** fields built via
  `approve()` / `request_changes(body)` / `comment(body)` (`.with_body(..)`,
  `kind()`/`body()` accessors, and the new public `ReviewKind` enum) instead of
  the `Approve(Option<String>)` / `RequestChanges(String)` / `Comment(String)`
  enum. This makes a body-less request-changes/comment unrepresentable. Argv
  unchanged.
- Bumped `processkit` to **0.8** — the re-exported `Error`/`ProcessResult` carry
  through 0.8 (`Error` still `#[non_exhaustive]` with `NotReady`/`Unsupported` and
  feature-gated `Cancelled`/`ResourceLimit`; `Error::Exit` Display gained a
  stderr-tail suffix; `Command` is `#[must_use]`). **Breaking** for consumers that
  match the re-exported types exhaustively, or that bump their own direct
  `processkit` separately — caret `"0.7"` does not span 0.8, so bump together.
- Internal: the `CliClient` verbs the wrapper bodies call were renamed to one
  shared vocabulary (`text`→`run`, `capture`→`output`, `unit`→`run_unit`,
  `code`→`exit_code`); no public-API or built-argv change.
- New off-by-default **`cancellation`** feature: pulls in processkit's
  `cancellation`, so `cli_client!` emits `default_cancel_on(token)` on the client —
  build a cancellable client (every command it runs dies when the token fires) and
  pass it through the facade. No new vcs-* API; `CancellationToken` is re-exported
  from `processkit`. The `run_watch` cancellation path is covered by a hermetic
  paused-clock test (`Reply::pending()`).
- Internal: the argv injection guard (`reject_flag_like`) now comes from the
  shared `vcs-cli-support` crate. No public API change.
- `auth_status` reports `false` on **any** non-zero exit (was: errored on exits
  other than 0/1), matching its "reports the bool, must not error" contract.

### Fixed
- `pr_list`/`pr_list_for_branch`/`issue_list`/`release_list` pass `--limit 100`
  — gh's default of 30 silently truncated larger result sets. The cap is now
  explicit and documented (use `run()` for more).

## [0.4.0] - 2026-06-04

### Added
- `GitHub::at(dir)` → `GitHubAt`, a cwd-bound view whose repo-scoped methods omit
  the leading `dir` argument (`gh.at(dir).pr_list()`).

### Changed
- Bumped `processkit` to 0.6; `auth_status` uses processkit's `probe()` (exit `0`/`1`
  → bool, anything else → error). No API change.

### Fixed
-

- Release: vcs-git v0.1.0, vcs-jj v0.1.0, vcs-github v0.1.0

## [0.3.0] - 2026-06-02

### Added
- Inherent `GitHub::run_args` / `run_raw_args` taking `&[&str]`, so callers
  needn't allocate a `Vec<String>` for the `run` escape hatch.
- `pr_list_for_branch(dir, head, base)` — PRs that merge `head` into `base` in
  any state (`gh pr list --head <head> --base <base> --state all --json …`), each
  carrying its title, URL, and state.

### Changed
- `pr_create` gained a `head: Option<String>` parameter (before `base`) so a PR
  can target an explicit source branch (`gh pr create --head <head>`); `None`
  keeps the previous behaviour (head = current branch).
- Bumped `processkit` to 0.5. No change to the rest of this crate's public API.

### Fixed
-

## [0.2.1] - 2026-06-01

### Added
-

### Changed
- Bumped `processkit` to 0.4 — macOS/BSD process trees are now contained via a

- Release: vcs-git v0.1.0, vcs-jj v0.1.0, vcs-github v0.1.0

## [0.1.0] - 2026-06-01

### Added
- `GitHubApi` trait + `GitHub` client with typed commands deserializing
  `gh … --json` into structs: `pr_list`/`pr_view` (`PullRequest`), `issue_list`
  (`Issue`), `repo_view` (`Repo`), `auth_status`, and raw `api`. Adds
  `serde`/`serde_json`.
- **Mockable by design:** consumers code against `GitHubApi`; `GitHub::with_runner`
  injects a fake process runner, and the `mock` feature generates `MockGitHubApi`
  (via `mockall`).
- `pr_create` and raw `run`/`run_raw` on `GitHubApi`.
- `PullRequest` gained `base_ref_name` and `url`; `Repo` now has `owner`, `url`,
  `is_private`, and `default_branch`.
- `GitHub::default_timeout` kills any command exceeding the deadline.

### Changed
- The API is now the `GitHub` client + `GitHubApi` trait — the original free
  functions are gone. Commands launch `gh` inside an OS job (Windows Job Object /
  Linux cgroup v2) via `processkit`, killed on close.
- **Now async (tokio):** every `GitHubApi` method is `async`; errors are the typed
  `processkit::Error` (JSON parse failures become `Error::Parse`).
  Adds `async-trait`.
- Built on the external **`processkit`** crate (the `CliClient` core, the
  `cli_client!` macro, the `ProcessRunner` seam, and the structured `Error`) —
  replacing the prototype internal `vcs-process` crate. `run_raw` now returns
  `processkit::ProcessResult<String>`.
- `PullRequest`/`Issue`/`Repo` are now `#[non_exhaustive]` — future fields won't
  be breaking changes.
- Optional `tracing` feature (forwards to `processkit/tracing`): a `debug` event
  per `gh` command.

### Fixed
- `auth_status` no longer reports "not authenticated" when `gh auth status` times
  out — a timeout surfaces as `processkit::Error::Timeout` (via `CliClient::code`,
  backed by processkit 0.3's first-class timeout error).
