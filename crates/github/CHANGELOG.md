This crate is versioned and published independently of the other workspace

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Typed commands deserializing `gh … --json` into structs: `pr_list`/`pr_view`
  (`PullRequest`), `issue_list` (`Issue`), `repo_view` (`Repo`), `auth_status`,
  and raw `api`, plus an `exec()` builder preset. Adds `serde`/`serde_json`.

### Changed
- `run` now launches `gh` inside an OS job (Windows Job Object / Linux cgroup v2)
  via `vcs-process`, so the process tree is killed on close — no orphaned
  subprocesses.

### Fixed
-

## [0.1.0] - 2026-05-29

### Added
- Initial skeleton: `run` CLI-execution helper and `version()` over the `gh` binary.
