# Changelog — vcs-cli-support

All notable changes to the `vcs-cli-support` crate are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this crate adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).
This crate is versioned and published independently of the other workspace
crates; tag releases as `vcs-cli-support-v<version>`.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Initial release: the `processkit`-coupled plumbing the CLI wrappers share —
  `reject_flag_like` (the argv injection guard, parameterized by program name),
  the `FETCH_ATTEMPTS`/`FETCH_BACKOFF` fetch-retry policy, and the error
  classifiers `is_merge_conflict` / `is_nothing_to_commit` /
  `is_transient_fetch_error`. Extracted from the copies previously duplicated
  across `vcs-git` and `vcs-jj` so the transient-failure marker list and the
  classifiers can no longer drift between backends.

### Changed
- `reject_flag_like` also refuses whitespace-only values (as meaning-changing as
  empty ones), not just empty and leading-`-`.

### Fixed
-
