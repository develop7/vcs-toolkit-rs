//! `vcs-cli-support` — the [`processkit`]-coupled plumbing the CLI wrappers reuse.
//!
//! `vcs-git` / `vcs-jj` / `vcs-github` all drive a CLI through [`processkit`], so
//! they share three concerns that *touch* [`processkit::Error`]: an argv injection
//! guard, a fetch-retry policy, and a set of [`Error`] classifiers. Extracting them
//! here keeps the std-only `vcs-diff` clean of the `processkit` dependency, and —
//! more to the point — keeps the marker lists and classifier logic from drifting
//! between backends. The wrapper crates re-export these items (so you reach them
//! as `vcs_git::is_merge_conflict`, not via this crate's name) and rarely name
//! `vcs-cli-support` directly.
//!
//! # The surface
//!
//! - **[`reject_flag_like`]** — the injection guard for bare positional argv slots.
//!   A caller value that is empty/whitespace, or starts with `-`, is refused before
//!   spawning (the CLI would parse it as a flag); flag-*value* slots (`-m <msg>`)
//!   are consumed verbatim and skip the check. Wrappers call it with their own
//!   binary name so the surfaced [`Error::Spawn`] names the right `program`.
//! - **[`FETCH_ATTEMPTS`] / [`FETCH_BACKOFF`]** — the shared transient-retry policy
//!   for `fetch` (one try plus two retries, fixed backoff between them).
//! - **[`is_merge_conflict`] / [`is_nothing_to_commit`] / [`is_transient_fetch_error`]
//!   / [`is_lock_contention`]** — classify a returned [`Error`] so callers branch on
//!   *intent* ("conflict, resolve it"; "nothing to commit, no-op"; "transient,
//!   retry"; "another process holds the lock, retry") instead of matching on error
//!   internals. They inspect captured [`Error::Exit`] output against fixed marker
//!   lists (and treat a [`processkit`] [`Error::Timeout`] as transient); any
//!   unfamiliar `#[non_exhaustive]` variant falls through to "no".
//! - **[`RetryPolicy`] / [`retry_async`] / [`ManagedClient`]** — an opt-in retry
//!   strategy (attempts + exponential, jittered backoff) for **lock-contention**
//!   failures. `ManagedClient` wraps a [`processkit`] `CliClient` and applies the
//!   policy to every command, so the `vcs-git`/`vcs-jj` clients gain retry via
//!   `with_retry(...)` without changing a call site. Lock-acquisition failures are
//!   pre-execution, so retrying is safe even for mutating commands.
//! - **[`CredentialProvider`] / [`Credential`] / [`Secret`]** — an opt-in seam for
//!   supplying a secret *per operation* (a CI token, a vault lookup) instead of
//!   relying on ambient CLI auth. `ManagedClient` injects the resolved token into
//!   each command (the forge `GH_TOKEN`/`GITLAB_TOKEN` env); git uses
//!   [`git_credential_helper`] to keep the secret out of `argv`. Default is no
//!   provider → ambient auth, unchanged. See the [`credentials`](mod@credentials)
//!   module for the full picture.
//!
//! # Recipes
//!
//! Classify a failed `fetch` to drive a retry decision — branch on intent, not on
//! the error's internals:
//!
//! ```no_run
//! use vcs_cli_support::{is_transient_fetch_error, FETCH_ATTEMPTS, FETCH_BACKOFF};
//! # fn run() -> Result<(), processkit::Error> { todo!() }
//! # fn demo() -> Result<(), processkit::Error> {
//! for attempt in 1..=FETCH_ATTEMPTS {
//!     match run() {
//!         Ok(()) => break,
//!         Err(e) if is_transient_fetch_error(&e) && attempt < FETCH_ATTEMPTS => {
//!             std::thread::sleep(FETCH_BACKOFF); // DNS/timeout — worth a retry
//!         }
//!         Err(e) => return Err(e),               // anything else: give up
//!     }
//! }
//! # Ok(()) }
//! ```
