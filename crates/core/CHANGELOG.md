# Changelog — vcs-core

All notable changes to the `vcs-core` crate are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this crate adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).
This crate is versioned and published independently of the other workspace
crates; tag releases as `vcs-core-v<version>`.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- `Repo::cleanup_worktree_blocking(path)` — synchronous, best-effort worktree
  removal for a `Drop` guard that can't `.await` (git: `worktree remove --force`;
  jj: resolve the workspace name by path, delete the dir, `workspace forget`).

### Changed
- Requires `vcs-git` / `vcs-jj` **0.4** (for the new `blocking` helpers). Bump the
  path-dep `version` to `"0.4"` only **after** those crates are published at 0.4 —
  see the release note below.

### Fixed
-

## [0.1.0] - 2026-06-03

### Added
- Initial release: a unified facade over `vcs-git` and `vcs-jj`.
- `detect(dir) -> Option<Located>` — walk up to find a `.git`/`.jj` repository
  (jj wins when colocated), returning `BackendKind` + root.
- `Repo` — a cwd-bound handle (`Repo::open`, `Repo::at`) dispatching the common
  surface to whichever backend is present: `current_branch`, `trunk`,
  `changed_files`, `diff_stat`, `commit_paths`, `fetch`, `list_worktrees`,
  `create_worktree`, `remove_worktree`, plus `local_branches`, `branch_exists`,
  `has_uncommitted_changes`, `delete_branch`, `rename_branch` — with `git()` /
  `jj()` escape hatches for tool-specific operations.
- Backend-agnostic, `#[non_exhaustive]` DTOs: `BackendKind`, `ChangeKind`,
  `FileChange`, `DiffStat`, `WorktreeInfo`, `CreateOutcome`.
- Generic over the `processkit::ProcessRunner` so tests can inject a fake runner
  via `Repo::from_git` / `Repo::from_jj`.
- Re-exports `vcs_git` and `vcs_jj` so a consumer depending only on `vcs-core`
  can reach the raw clients and their types without a separate dependency.
