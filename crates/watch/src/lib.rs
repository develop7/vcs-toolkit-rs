//! `vcs-watch` — filesystem-watch a git/jj repository and emit typed state-change
//! events.
//!
//! A [`RepoWatcher`] watches a repository's `.git`/`.jj` state directory (and,
//! optionally, the working tree), **debounces** the burst of writes a VCS
//! operation makes, **re-queries** the repo state through
//! [`vcs-core`](vcs_core)'s batched [`snapshot`](vcs_core::Repo::snapshot), and
//! **diffs** it against the previous state to yield typed [`RepoEvent`]s. Each
//! settled change arrives as a [`RepoChange`] carrying both the new
//! [`RepoSnapshot`] (to render a prompt/status line) and the deltas (to react).
//! It's the foundation for prompts, status bars, TUIs, and repo daemons.
//!
//! Re-query-and-diff — rather than interpreting raw filesystem events — is what
//! makes it robust: git's ref temp-file renames, `index.lock` churn, and reflog
//! noise all just coalesce into one "re-check the settled state" instead of being
//! (mis)read as events. Noise that doesn't move observable state emits nothing,
//! and every emission carries the true current state, so a stray event can't
//! desync the consumer.
//!
//! # The surface
//!
//! - **[`RepoWatcher`]** — a live watch over one repository. Start it with
//!   [`RepoWatcher::watch`] (defaults) or the [`Builder`]; drop it to stop the OS
//!   watch and the background task.
//! - **[`Builder`]** ([`RepoWatcher::builder`]) — set the watch scope and timing,
//!   then [`build`](Builder::build): [`working_tree`](Builder::working_tree) to
//!   also watch the tree recursively, [`debounce`](Builder::debounce) (the quiet
//!   window), [`max_wait`](Builder::max_wait) (the re-query ceiling under a
//!   continuous stream), [`requery_timeout`](Builder::requery_timeout) (the
//!   per-re-query deadline). The [`DEFAULT_REQUERY_TIMEOUT`] et al. name the
//!   defaults.
//! - **[`RepoEvent`]** — one typed delta, derived by diffing two snapshots:
//!   [`HeadMoved`](RepoEvent::HeadMoved),
//!   [`BranchSwitched`](RepoEvent::BranchSwitched),
//!   [`BranchCreated`](RepoEvent::BranchCreated) /
//!   [`BranchDeleted`](RepoEvent::BranchDeleted),
//!   [`WorkingCopyChanged`](RepoEvent::WorkingCopyChanged), and the
//!   upstream/ahead-behind/operation/conflict variants (`#[non_exhaustive]`).
//! - **[`RepoChange`]** — a settled change: the fresh [`RepoSnapshot`] (render a
//!   status line off it) plus the non-empty `events` vec (react to it).
//! - **Consumption** — pull changes with [`recv`](RepoWatcher::recv)
//!   (`Option<RepoChange>`; `None` once dropped), or, under the **`stream`**
//!   feature, poll the watcher as a `futures_core::Stream`. Both pull from the
//!   same channel and advance [`current`](RepoWatcher::current), the last-pulled
//!   snapshot.
//! - **[`WatcherStats`]** ([`stats`](RepoWatcher::stats)) — lock-free health
//!   counters (re-queries run, changes emitted, skips, and the last skip's
//!   [`WatcherErrorKind`]). Climbing [`skipped`](WatcherStats::skipped) with flat
//!   [`changes`](WatcherStats::changes) means a wedged repo — poll it from a
//!   health check rather than inferring health from event silence.
//!
//! # Recipes
//!
//! Watch with the defaults and react to each settled change:
//!
//! ```no_run
//! use vcs_core::Repo;
//! use vcs_watch::RepoWatcher;
//! # async fn run() -> vcs_watch::Result<()> {
//! let repo = Repo::open(".")?;
//! let mut watcher = RepoWatcher::watch(repo).await?;
//! while let Some(change) = watcher.recv().await {
//!     for event in &change.events {
//!         println!("{event:?}");
//!     }
//!     // `change.snapshot` is the fresh full state — render a status line off it.
//! }
//! # Ok(()) }
//! ```
//!
//! Under the **`stream`** feature the watcher *is* a `futures_core::Stream`,
//! so it drops into stream combinators and `tokio::select!` directly (needs
//! `futures`/`tokio-stream`'s `StreamExt` in scope):
//!
//! ```ignore
//! use futures::StreamExt;
//! use vcs_core::Repo;
//! use vcs_watch::RepoWatcher;
//! # async fn run() -> vcs_watch::Result<()> {
//! let repo = Repo::open(".")?;
//! let mut watcher = RepoWatcher::watch(repo).await?;
//! while let Some(change) = watcher.next().await {
//!     println!("{} event(s)", change.events.len());
//! }
//! # Ok(()) }
//! ```
//!
//! **Runtime:** unlike the rest of the toolkit (which hides tokio behind
//! `processkit`), `vcs-watch` uses **tokio at runtime** — the watch task and the
//! debounce timer run on the caller's tokio runtime, so build/await it from
//! within one.
//!
//! # Testing
//!
//! The debounce → ceiling → re-query pipeline is a free function over injected
//! seams, so it is exercised hermetically on a **paused clock** (no real
//! filesystem or sleeps); a consumer's own watch code tests the same way it tests
//! any [`vcs-core`](vcs_core) consumer — build the [`Repo`](vcs_core::Repo) over a
//! fake runner (processkit's `ScriptedRunner`) so the re-query returns canned
//! state. See
//! [vcs-testkit's guide](https://docs.rs/vcs-testkit/latest/vcs_testkit/guide/testing/).
//!
//! # In-depth guide
//!
//! Beyond this page, this crate ships a full how-to guide — rendered on docs.rs
//! from `docs/`. See the [`guide`] module.
