//! The typed events and the **pure** snapshot-diff that derives them.

//! The watcher re-queries repo state on each filesystem change and diffs the new
//! state against the old; [`diff`] turns a (previous, next) pair into the list of

//! no process, no async — so the load-bearing logic is hermetically unit-tested.
