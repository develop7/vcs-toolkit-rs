# Changelog — vcs-jj

All notable changes to the `vcs-jj` crate are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this crate adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).
This crate is versioned and published independently of the other workspace
crates; tag releases as `vcs-jj-v<version>`.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- `description(dir, revset)` — the full (multiline) description of the commit a
  revset resolves to (`log --limit 1 -T description`); empty for an undescribed
  change, newest commit only (log order) for a multi-commit revset.
- `git_fetch_from(dir, remote)` — fetch from a *named* git remote
  (`git fetch --remote <remote>`), retried on transient failures like
  `git_fetch`.
- `Jj::transaction(dir, |tx| …)` (also on `JjAt`) — run a mutation sequence with
  op-log rollback: captures `op_head`, hands the closure a bound `JjAt`, and
  restores the captured operation when the closure returns `Err`. Inherent (not
  on the trait — generic closures aren't mockable); rollback runs on `Err` only,
  not on panic/cancellation.
- `git_clone(url, dest, colocate)` — `jj git clone` without a working
  directory (pass an absolute `dest`). The colocate flag is always passed
  explicitly (`--colocate`/`--no-colocate`): jj's default flipped across
  versions and is overridable via `git.colocate` config.
- `absorb(dir, from, filesets)` — fold working-copy edits into the mutable
  ancestors that introduced the touched lines; empty `filesets` absorbs
  everything.
- `split_paths(dir, filesets, message)` — carve named filesets out of `@` into
  their own described commit (the `-m` keeps it non-interactive). Empty
  `filesets` are refused before spawning — a fileset-less `jj split` opens the
  interactive diff editor, a headless hang.
- `duplicate(dir, revset)`.
- `op_log(dir, limit)` → `Vec<Operation>` (id/user/start-time/description) —
  the listing counterpart of `op_head`.
- `evolog(dir, revset, max)` → `Vec<Change>` — how a change evolved, newest
  snapshot first. (Evolog templates render in a *commit* context, so this uses
  a `commit.`-method-form template, unlike `log`.)
- `file_annotate(dir, path, rev)` → `Vec<AnnotationLine>` (change id + 1-based
  line + content) and `file_show(dir, revset, path)` — file content at a
  revision (lossy for binary). `file_show` wraps the path as an exact-path
  fileset (`file:"…"`) so fileset metacharacters stay literal; `file_annotate`
  deliberately doesn't — `jj file annotate` takes a plain path and rejects the
  quoted form.
- `capabilities()` → `JjCapabilities { version: JjVersion }` — the installed
  binary's parsed version (tolerates `-dev`/build-hash suffixes), with
  `is_supported()` / `ensure_supported()` gating **precisely** on jj ≥ 0.38,
  the empirically validated floor (jj's CLI moves fast; every parser and flag
  in this crate was verified against that release). A value type: probe once
  and keep it.
- Injection guards on the exposed positional arguments (bookmark names,
  positional revsets, `new_merge` parents, operation ids, the `git_clone`
  url, the `bookmark_track` `name@remote` token): a leading-`-` or empty
  value is refused **before** anything spawns; `file_annotate`'s path goes
  after a `--` separator. Flag-value positions (`-r`, `-m`) need no guard —
  jj's CLI rejects dash-values there itself.
- `RevsetExpr` validating newtype — optional up-front validation for
  untrusted input (non-empty, no leading `-`; the full revset grammar is
  deliberately not modelled). Method signatures stay `&str`.
- `conflict` module — a typed model of jj's **materialized** conflicts
  (native `diff` and `snapshot` marker styles, `conflict N of M` counters,
  marker-length matching): `parse_conflicts` → segments, byte-exact
  `render`, `resolve(…, JjResolution::{Side(n),Base})` — for `diff` style
  the side content is reconstructed by applying the recorded diff. Files
  materialized with the `git` marker style parse via `vcs_git::conflict`
  (documented asymmetry).
- Doc note: there is deliberately no `Jj::hardened()` — jj has no repo-local
  hooks; in a colocated repo the risk lives on the git side, so harden the
  `Git` client instead.
- `Jj::workspace_roots(dir, names)` — resolve several workspaces' roots in one
  **bounded fan-out** (processkit 0.8 `output_all`, ≤ 8 concurrent `workspace
  root --name <n>` calls) instead of awaiting them one by one; per-name `Ok`/`Err`
  mirrors `workspace_root`, results in input order. Inherent (throughput shape
  over the trait method). The facade's worktree enumeration (`Repo::list_worktrees`)
  uses it.

### Changed
- `squash_paths(dir, from, into, filesets, use_destination_message)` now takes a
  single `SquashPaths` spec — `squash_paths(dir, SquashPaths::new(from, into)
  .filesets(…).use_destination_message())` — mirroring `WorkspaceAdd`. *Breaking*
  for the `squash_paths` signature; argv is byte-identical.
- Bumped `processkit` to **0.8** — the re-exported `Error`/`ProcessResult` carry
  through 0.8 (`Error` still `#[non_exhaustive]` with `NotReady`/`Unsupported` and
  feature-gated `Cancelled`/`ResourceLimit`; `Error::Exit` Display gained a
  stderr-tail suffix; `Command` is `#[must_use]`). **Breaking** for consumers that
  match the re-exported types exhaustively, or that bump their own direct
  `processkit` separately — caret `"0.7"` does not span 0.8, so bump together.
- Internal: the `CliClient` verbs the wrapper bodies call were renamed to one
  shared vocabulary (`text`→`run`, `capture`→`output`, `unit`→`run_unit`,
  `code`→`exit_code`); no public-API or built-argv change.
- New off-by-default **`cancellation`** feature: pulls in processkit's
  `cancellation`, so `cli_client!` emits `default_cancel_on(token)` on the client —
  build a cancellable client (every command it runs dies when the token fires) and
  pass it through the facade. No new vcs-* API; `CancellationToken` is re-exported
  from `processkit`.
- Internal: the diff model + parser (`ChangeKind`/`DiffLine`/`Hunk`/`FileDiff`/
  `DiffStat`/`parse_diff`) and the version type now come from the shared
  `vcs-diff` crate, and the transient-fetch classifier + the argv injection guard
  from `vcs-cli-support` — both re-exported, so the public API is unchanged
  (`vcs_jj::FileDiff`, `vcs_jj::is_transient_fetch_error`, … still resolve;
  `JjVersion` is now an alias of `vcs_diff::Version`). Removes the byte-identical
  duplication with `vcs-git`. `parse_diff` is now part of the public surface.

### Fixed
-

## [0.4.0] - 2026-06-04

### Added
- `Jj::at(dir)` → `JjAt`, a cwd-bound view whose methods omit the leading `dir`
  argument (`jj.at(dir).status()`); the dir-taking `JjApi` stays for driving many
  workspaces from one client.
- `reachable_bookmarks` — local bookmarks on the nearest commits reachable from
  `@` (`log -r 'heads(::@ & bookmarks())'`), the candidate targets a commit belongs
  to; one entry per name when a commit carries several.
- `resolve_list(revset)` — conflicted paths from `jj resolve --list` (empty when
  there are none, including the no-conflict non-zero exit).
- Revision-scoped variants of the `@`-only ops: `describe_rev(revset, msg)` and
  `rebase_branch(branch, dest)` (`rebase -b … -d …`).
- Remote-tracking bookmarks: `bookmarks_all` (`bookmark list -a`, new `BookmarkRef`
  with name/remote/target/tracked) and `bookmark_track(name, remote)`.
- `FileDiff.raw` — the verbatim per-file diff section.
- Sync `blocking::workspace_forget` and `blocking::workspace_name_for_path`
  (resolve a workspace name by path) for `Drop`-time cleanup that can't `.await`.

### Changed
- `squash_into` and `squash_paths` gained a `use_destination_message: bool`
  (`--use-destination-message`) — *breaking* for these two signatures.
- Bumped `processkit` to 0.6. `git_fetch` / `git_fetch_branch` now retry transient
  failures (3 attempts, 500 ms backoff).

### Fixed
- Every `jj` invocation now forces `--color never`, so a user's
  `ui.color = "always"` config can no longer wrap templated output (and the error
  text classified by `is_transient_fetch_error`) in ANSI escapes and break parsing.
- A change description containing a literal tab is no longer truncated when parsing
  `jj log` template rows (`splitn` keeps the remainder).
- `diff_summary` parenthesises each endpoint of the `<from>..<to>` revset range, so
  a compound revset keeps its meaning instead of rebinding by operator precedence.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-06-02

### Added
- Typed diff: `diff_text(dir, DiffSpec)` returns the raw git-format unified diff
  (`diff -r <spec> --git`), and `diff(dir, DiffSpec)` returns a parsed
  `Vec<FileDiff>` (change kind, path, rename old-path, and `@@` hunks with
  per-line `DiffLine`s). The pure parser `parse::parse_diff` is public for
  parsing externally-obtained diff text. `DiffSpec::WorkingTree` diffs `@`;
  `DiffSpec::Rev(_)` diffs a revset.
- Partial-change ops with a safe `JjFileset` newtype (escapes `\`/`"`, renders
  `file:"…"`): `commit_paths`, `squash_paths`, and `sparse_set` (`sparse set
  --clear --add …`). `WorkspaceAdd` gains a `sparse(SparseMode)` builder
  (`workspace add --sparse-patterns copy|full|empty`).
- `status_text` — the raw `jj status` text (the previous `status` return), and
  `is_transient_fetch_error` classifier mirroring `vcs_git`.
- Inherent `Jj::run_args` / `run_raw_args` taking `&[&str]`, so callers needn't
  allocate a `Vec<String>` for the `run` escape hatch.

### Changed
- `status` now returns parsed `Vec<ChangedPath>` (backed by `diff -r @ --summary`)
  instead of the raw `jj status` string, mirroring `vcs_git::GitApi::status`. The
  raw text moved to the new `status_text`.
- Bumped `processkit` to 0.5. No change to the rest of this crate's public API.

### Fixed
-

## [0.2.1] - 2026-06-01

### Added
-

### Changed
- Bumped `processkit` to 0.4 — macOS/BSD process trees are now contained via a
  POSIX process group (`killpg` on drop) instead of an uncontained spawn.

### Fixed
-

## [0.2.0] - 2026-06-01

### Added
- **Workspace management:** `workspace_list` (new `Workspace` struct),
  `workspace_root`, `workspace_add` (`WorkspaceAdd` options), `workspace_forget`.
- **Discovery:** `root`, `current_bookmark`, `trunk`.
- **Bookmarks:** `bookmark_create`, `bookmark_rename`, `bookmark_delete`,
  `bookmark_move`.
- **Diff / query / state:** `diff_summary` (new `ChangedPath` struct), `diff_stat`
  (new `DiffStat` struct), `commit_count`, `is_conflicted`,
  `has_workingcopy_conflict`, and `template_query` (a typed `jj log -T` escape hatch).
- **Mutations:** `rebase`, `edit`, `squash_into`, `new_merge`, `abandon`,
  `git_fetch_branch`, `git_import`.
- **Operation log:** `op_head`, `op_restore`, `op_undo`.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-06-01

### Added
- `JjApi` trait + `Jj` client with typed, repo-scoped commands returning parsed
  structs: `log`/`current_change` (`Change`), `describe`/`new_change`, `status`,
  `bookmarks` (`Bookmark`).
- **Mockable by design:** consumers code against `JjApi`; `Jj::with_runner`
  injects a fake process runner, and the `mock` feature generates `MockJjApi`
  (via `mockall`).
- `bookmark_set`, `git_fetch`, `git_push`, and raw `run`/`run_raw` on `JjApi`.
- `Change` gained the `empty` flag (no file modifications).
- `Jj::default_timeout` kills any command exceeding the deadline.

### Changed
- The API is now the `Jj` client + `JjApi` trait — the original free functions
  are gone. Commands launch `jj` inside an OS job (Windows Job Object / Linux
  cgroup v2) via `processkit`, killed on close.
- **Now async (tokio):** every `JjApi` method is `async`; errors are the typed
  `processkit::Error`. Adds `async-trait`.
- Built on the external **`processkit`** crate (the `CliClient` core, the
  `cli_client!` macro, the `ProcessRunner` seam, and the structured `Error`) —
  replacing the prototype internal `vcs-process` crate. `run_raw` now returns
  `processkit::ProcessResult<String>`.
- `Change`/`Bookmark` are now `#[non_exhaustive]` — future fields won't be
  breaking changes.
- Optional `tracing` feature (forwards to `processkit/tracing`): a `debug` event
  per `jj` command.
