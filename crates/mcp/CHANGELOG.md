# Changelog — vcs-mcp

All notable changes to the `vcs-mcp` crate are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this crate adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).
This crate is versioned and published independently of the other workspace
crates; tag releases as `vcs-mcp-v<version>`.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Read tool** `forge_info` (always available, `readOnlyHint`): the forge
  identity + flat capability map. Returns
  `{ kind, capabilities: { pr_create, pr_comment, pr_edit, pr_checks, pr_merge,
  issue_create, authed } }` where `kind` is `"github"` / `"gitlab"` /
  `"gitea"` and the per-op flags are the intersection of "the CLI ships
  the command" and "the CLI is authenticated" (a single `auth status` /
  `login list` probe is spawned; the rest is a static table). Errors with
  `invalid_params` ("no forge is configured for this repository …") when
  no forge is bound to the server, matching the other `forge_*` tools.
- **Mutating tools** (gated, `destructiveHint`):
  - `forge_pr_mark_ready({ number })` — mark a draft PR/MR ready for review
    (`Unsupported` on Gitea). Closes a parity gap: the `Forge` facade has
    `pr_mark_ready`, but no MCP tool surfaced it, so a draft→ready workflow wasn't
    drivable over MCP.
  - `forge_pr_comment({ number, body })` — post a markdown comment to an
    existing PR/MR; returns the CLI output (the comment URL on success).
  - `forge_pr_edit({ number, title?, body? })` — edit a PR/MR's title
    and/or body. At least one of `title` or `body` must be set; both
    absent is rejected up front as `invalid_params` (the facade's
    `Error::InvalidInput` mapped to an MCP `invalid_params` error). An
    empty string is a real value (clears the field) — it passes the
    belt-and-braces argv guard at the MCP seam and the wrapper's
    flag-VALUE-position pass-through.
- **Param structs**: `PrCommentParams`, `PrEditParams` (each
  `Deserialize` + `JsonSchema` — their schema is the tool's advertised
  input schema). `PrEditParams` is `Option`-typed on `title`/`body` so
  the JSON form can omit either (or both) without serde complaining.
- **Error mapping**: `vcs_forge::Error::InvalidInput` (a new variant on
  the facade's error, used by the both-`None` rejection on `pr_edit`) is
  mapped to MCP `invalid_params` alongside the existing
  `Error::Unsupported` mapping — both are client-fixable errors.
- **Pre-spawn argv guard** in the MCP layer (`guard_argv_field`): mirrors
  the wrappers' `reject_flag_like` for the `body` / `title` fields of
  the two new mutating tools. A leading-`-` is refused up front; an
  empty string is allowed (it clears the field). The wrappers still run
  their own guards — this is the second line of defence at the MCP seam.

### Changed
- **`repo_try_merge` is now write-gated (breaking).** It was a read tool
  (`readOnlyHint`), but it spawns a *real* trial merge that materializes working-tree
  content — which on an untrusted repository can run repo-local `filter`/`textconv`
  drivers the hardened client does not sandbox, the same code-execution class as
  `repo_checkout` (already gated). It now requires `--allow-write` (or
  `--allow-tools repo_try_merge`) and is in `WRITE_TOOLS`; its annotation is
  corrected to non-destructive/idempotent (it still rolls back, leaving no net
  trace). The default read-only mode therefore no longer exposes any working-tree-
  materializing operation; the MCP docs note the residual `textconv`-on-diff vector
  for fully untrusted repos.
- **Tool JSON output reflects the updated `vcs-core`/`vcs-forge` DTOs (breaking for
  wire consumers).** `repo_snapshot` now nests upstream tracking under one
  `tracking` object (`{branch, ahead, behind}` or `null`) instead of three flat
  `upstream`/`ahead`/`behind` fields; release results carry `body`/`draft`/
  `prerelease`; issue results carry `body`/`url`; PR check `bucket` is the typed
  `CheckBucket` value.
- Bumped `processkit` to **0.11.0**. Test doubles moved to `processkit::testing`;
  cancellation is now core (no feature flag).

## [0.2.0] - 2026-06-13

### Added
- **Read tools** (always available, `readOnlyHint`) — `repo_log`,
  `repo_diff`, `repo_refs`. `repo_log` returns the committed history as a
  list of [`LogEntry`](https://docs.rs/vcs-core/latest/vcs_core/guide/)s
  (sha, parents, author/committer identity, body, optional per-commit
  files); `repo_diff` returns a range or working-copy diff in the chosen
  format (unified text / names / stat) with an optional `max_bytes` cap on
  the unified text; `repo_refs` returns the ref-state bundle (HEAD,
  current branch, default branch, remotes) in one call. All three replace
  the workflow-side bash dispatchers (`git log` / `git diff` /
  `git rev-parse` / `git remote get-url`) that previously had to live
  outside the MCP seam.

### Changed
- Bumped to 0.2.0 because the new public-API surface in the tool
  catalogue is an additive-but-meaningful change for the read side. No
  existing tool changed.
-

### Fixed
- **`--allow-tools` validates tool names up front.** An unknown/misspelled name is
  now rejected with an error listing the valid write tools, instead of being added
  to a silently-inert allowlist (a typo never matched a real tool, so the intended
  write stayed disabled with no warning). The canonical set is the new public
  `vcs_mcp::WRITE_TOOLS`; `require_write` debug-asserts every gated tool is listed
  there, so the two can't drift.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-06-08

### Added
- Initial release: `vcs-mcp`, a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server exposing the
  `vcs-core` (`Repo`) and `vcs-forge` (`Forge`) operations as agent-callable
  tools. A lib (`VcsMcpServer`, hermetically testable) plus the `vcs-mcp` binary,
  which serves MCP over **stdio** for an `mcpServers` config entry. The workspace's
  **first binary crate** and **second runtime-tokio** crate (after `vcs-watch`).
- **Read tools** (always available, annotated `readOnlyHint`): `repo_snapshot`,
  `repo_info`, `repo_status`, `repo_diff_stat`, `repo_branches`,
  `repo_current_branch`, `repo_conflicts`, `repo_worktrees`, `repo_try_merge`
  (a rollback merge probe); forge: `forge_auth_status`, `forge_repo_view`,
  `forge_pr_list`, `forge_pr_view`, `forge_pr_checks`, `forge_issue_list`,
  `forge_issue_view`, `forge_release_list`, `forge_release_view`. Each returns
  the facade DTO as JSON (via the facades' optional `serde` feature).
- **Mutating tools** (gated, annotated `destructiveHint`): `repo_commit`,
  `repo_checkout`, `repo_fetch`, `repo_push`, `repo_create_worktree`,
  `repo_remove_worktree`; forge: `forge_pr_create`, `forge_pr_merge`,
  `forge_pr_close`, `forge_issue_create`. Outside the write gate they reject up
  front — naming the tool — before spawning anything.
- **`WriteGate`** — the server's write policy (`None` / `All` /
  `Set(HashSet<tool name>)`), checked by every mutating tool under its own name.
  `VcsMcpServer::new` takes it in place of a coarse bool.
- **CLI:** `--repo <path>` (default cwd), `--forge github|gitlab|gitea` (override),
  `--allow-write` (every mutation), `--allow-tools <name,…>` (a per-tool
  allowlist; comma-separated, repeatable, accumulates; `--allow-write` wins when
  both are given), `--timeout <seconds>` (per-command deadline, default 120; `0`
  disables), `--help`. With neither write flag the server is read-only. The
  forge is auto-detected from the `origin` remote (`ForgeKind::from_remote_url`)
  — works on a colocated jj repo; a pure-jj repo with no git remote has no
  forge, and the `forge_*` tools then return a clear "no forge configured"
  error.
- **Hardened by default:** the binary opens the repo with a hardened git client
  (`Git::hardened()` — repo hooks and `core.fsmonitor` disabled, repo-redirecting
  `GIT_*` scrubbed, system config skipped), so serving a repository you didn't
  create can't execute its hooks even on a read tool. jj has no repo-local hooks.
  Every git/forge command also runs under the `--timeout` deadline so a stalled
  network call can't hang a request. The server advertises its identity as
  `vcs-mcp` (with the crate version) over the MCP wire.
- The tool logic, write-gating, serialization, and the `#[tool_router]`/
  `#[tool_handler]` wiring are covered hermetically (a `ScriptedRunner`-backed
  `Repo`, plus an in-process rmcp client round-trip over an in-memory duplex
  transport); `#[ignore]` tests drive the read tools and a gated mutation against a
  real temporary git repo.

### Notes
- Built on [`rmcp`](https://crates.io/crates/rmcp) (the official MCP Rust SDK).
  Read-only by default. The wrappers' argv injection guards apply under every
  tool.
